## Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

### Q.1. Identify Functrional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements:

### Functional Requirements:
- The user should be able to search for books in the library using criteria such as the title, author, publication date, etc., depending on their needs.
- A system need to display all the essential information about the book.
- When a user wants to issue the book, the system should prompt them for their username and password. The system determines whether the entered information is correct, such as whether the password is entered correctly or whether the entered username is valid.
- Only if the user is a member of the system should the LIS system allow the user to borrow a book or return it if it has already been borrowed. Once a librarian acknowledges a user's request to borrow a book, the user is then able to do so.
- The system should display the book's location in the library after it had been borrowed.
- The system should not provide the user the option to borrow a book if it has already been taken out by another user and should instead inform the user that the book has already been checked out by others.
- If a user requests a list of the books they have presently borrowed, books they have previously borrowed, the date they were borrowed, and the books they have returned, the system should display this information for that user.
- When a new book is purchased, a system should enable the librarian to add a new record, or remove a record if a book is taken off the shelf, as and when necessary. 
- System should notify the user and librarian of the overdue books and calculate the fine for the overdue books when they are returned.
